1. Make sure you have the latest source code. See the GitHub page at
   https://github.com/ricedsp/rwt
   If you have the command line git tool installed you should be able to run:
   git clone https://github.com/ricedsp/rwt.git

2. Properly set up your system to create MEX-files. Refer to the MATLAB 
   documentation section "Build MEX-Files" at 
   http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/building-mex-files.html

3. Run MATLAB and change to the "bin" subdirectory containing the .m files

4. Compile the toolbox by executing the Matlab command: compile

5. Add the toolbox "bin" subdirectory to your Matlab path.

Octave installation is similar to the procedure for MATLAB above. On Linux you
will need the octave-dev (Debian/Ubuntu) or octave-devel (RedHat, etc.) package
installed.

Python installation requires CMake. To install the python bindings, execute the
following commands:
 cd python
 cmake .
 sudo make install

On OSX, CMake is available from Macports http://www.macports.org/
For Redhat Enterprise Linux, Scientific Linux, CentOS, etc. there is a package
available on RepoForge http://repoforge.org/use/
