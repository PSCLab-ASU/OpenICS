function "vectorize.m" is renamed to "vector.m", and all the references to this function are updated.
This has been made to avoid overlap with MATLAB's "vectorize.m" function.


* November 11, 2004

- "denoi_BLS_GSM":
	* Fixed bug affecting images with dimensions non-multiple of exponents of two (in "denoi_BLS_GSM.m")
	* Fixed bug affecting the case when PS (the noise power spectral density) has different spatial dimensions from the image. 

- "decomp_reconst" ('s', 'fs', 'uw'):
	* Fixed bug affecting the computation of the noise covariance matrix (a small scalar factor)


* November 26, 2004

- "decomp_reconst" ('s', 'fs', 'uw'):
	* Fixed remaining bug affecting the computation of the noise covariance matrix (a small scalar factor for the parent)


* February 23, 2005

- "decomp_reconst_WU" :
	* Fixed remaining bug:
	Line 75
	"[BL, C_w] = denoi_BLS_GSM_band(BL,block,BLn,prnt,covariance,optim,sig);"
	is changed to:
	"BL = denoi_BLS_GSM_band(BL,block,BLn,prnt,covariance,optim,sig);"
