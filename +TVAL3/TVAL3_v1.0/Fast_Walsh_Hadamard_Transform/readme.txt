Introduction
====================
   
   fWHtrans is a C++ code implementing fast Walsh Hadamard transform 
(sequency order). ifWHtrans implements its inverse transform. They are
around 100 times faster than fwht.m and ifwht.m, which are standard functions
in Matlab R2008b to do the same thing. Users can also use both fWHtrans and 
ifWHtrans in Matlab after compiling fWHtrans.cpp into a Matlab "mex" file.


How To Use  
====================
For the first use, users should run warm_up.m, which would "mex" the file 
aotomatically. Users can also "mex" fWHtrans.cpp manually by type "mex -O 
fWHtrans.cpp" in the Matlab Command Window.


Then, users can call them as following:

               		y = fWHtrans(x)
 	   or       	y = ifWHtrans(x).


Both vectors and matrices are acceptable as input. If inputting matrices, the
fast Walsh Hadamard transform is applied column by column. Please be aware 
that the height (# of rows) of output may be bigger than the height of input.

     	height(y) = power(2, ceil( log2( height(x) ) ) )
